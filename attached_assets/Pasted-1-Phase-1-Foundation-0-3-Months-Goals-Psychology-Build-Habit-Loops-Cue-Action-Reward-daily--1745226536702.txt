1. Be Crystal Clear & Specific (What & How):

What to include: Phased milestones (0–3 months, 3–6 months, 6–12 months, 1–2 years, 2–5 years), core mechanics (XP, streaks, seasonal badges, “Wrapped” recap, veteran tiers, ambassador program).

How to present: Use action verbs, concise bullet‐style language, and a callout of measurable outcomes (feature adoption +50%, retention +40%).

2. Provide Rich Context:

Background: Gamification inspired by Spotify Wrapped, Opal’s growth forest, and top SaaS quest systems.

Examples: Mention shareable graphics, forest growth visuals, confetti micro‑animations, AI‑driven nudges.

3. Structure Effectively:

Instructions first: Begin summary with the vision.

Use separators: Clearly label each phase.

Balance detail & brevity: Target ~200 words total.

4. Iterate & Refine:

If it’s too generic, deepen with concrete rewards (discounts, swag, revenue share).

If it’s too long, tighten bullet points and focus on the “so what” for investors.
